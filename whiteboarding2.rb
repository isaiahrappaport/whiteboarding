# Given two strings of equal length, write a function that returns the number of characters that are different between the two strings.

# Output: 2

# Explanation: While the A, B, C, E, and G are in the same place for both strings, they have different characters in the other spaces. Since there are 2 such spaces that are different (the D and F in the first string), we return 2.

# Input: "ABCDEFG", "ABCDEFG",

# different = 1
# Output: 1

# write a function that takes in 2 strings of equal length
# return the total number of characters using a while loop and using the .length method
# set a variable called "different" to 0
